# Dotfiles

These files contain all the preferences for Mac OS X, Bash, and Git that I'm used to. To set up a new computer, there's just a couple things you'll need to do.

## Installation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosszurowski/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

## Sensible OS X Defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
. ./.osx
```

## Thanks

Many ideas in here were taken from [Mathias'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and [Evan You's](https://github.com/yyx990803/dotfiles) dotfile repos. Look there if you need help with this stuff.
